THIS PROGRAM IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

+Commit history line will serve as a ChangLog for now

We love Github's issue tracker(Please submit bugs here) and encourage people to fork and submit pull requests

+Make note of the git tags the main tree isn't always buildable as the app is still in development.  If you want to compile a working version of the app be sure to use the version tags

+This app is free(RootzWiki)/donation(Android Market) or you can compile it yourself
